# Bowling Scorecard

This is a Python implementation of a bowling scorecard program I had previously coded using JavaScript. I decided to translate the program as part of my efforts to learn Python. The program is designed to keep track of scores for a single player's game of bowling.

[Here is the original repository.](https://github.com/josephburgess/bowling-challenge-js)

## Getting Started

To use this program, you'll need to install Python 3.x on your machine. Once you've installed Python, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine.

Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

To run the program:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This will start the program and display a prompt asking you to enter the scores for each frame of your game.

## Running Tests

I used Pytest for testing this project and achieved 99% test coverage. 

To run the test suite for this project, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the command:

```bash
pytest
```
This will run all of the test cases in the tests directory.

## Reflecions

This is my third Python project, having previously worked mostly in JavaScript. I've been really enjoying Python so far - it's such a versatile language with a lot of powerful tools and libraries, and the syntax is very clean and easy to read. It feels like an extremely versatile language with lots of excellent functionality built in. I'm excited to keep experimenting with it going forward.

As for the project itself, I had a lot of fun creating it. It was a great opportunity for me to practice my object-oriented programming skills and work on my understanding of Python classes and methods. I'm really pleased with the final result and I hope you find it useful as well.

Thanks for checking out my project, and happy bowling!
